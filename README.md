# Instroduction
This is the github repository for the C6.5 Theories of Deep Learning Coursework Project *Physics-Informed Neural Networks: Tackling Complex
PDEs Through Dimension Separation and Causality* by Zihan Zhou. The repository is forked from [Junwoo Cho's original repo](https://jwcho5576.github.io/spinn.github.io/) for his paper  [*Separable physics-informed neural networks*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15969), published at Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2023).
