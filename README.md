# Instroduction
This is the github repository for the C6.5 Theories of Deep Learning Coursework Project *Physics-Informed Neural Networks: Tackling Complex
PDEs Through Dimension Separation and Causality* by Zihan Zhou. The project report is available at `ZihanZhou_report.pdf`. This repository is forked from [Junwoo Cho's original repo](https://github.com/stnamjef/SPINN) for his paper  [*Separable physics-informed neural networks*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15969), published at Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2023).

# Main Contribution
This report investigates the introduction of causality into Separable Physics-Informed Neural Networks(SPINN), and tested the effect on Klein-Gordon equation and diffusion equation. THe relevant codes are available at `diffusion3d_causal.py` and `causal_spinn_kleingordon.ipynb`, where the causality parameter is set to `1e-3`. The results are summarised in the `Causal_results_KleinGordon` and `causal_results_diffusion` folders.
